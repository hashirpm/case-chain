# CaseChain 🔐

CaseChain is a blockchain-based evidence management system to prevent manipulation in courts.

Users can add evidence to this decentralized application for any case number. Since blockchain technology is used, once the data has been successfully uploaded to the blockchain network, it cannot be modified. As a result, a digital trail is made that links the gathering of evidence at the crime scene to the courtroom.

## Why CaseChain ❓

In court, a lot of evidence is falsified, and as a result, innocent people are sued. The court must rely on all of the intermediaries that stand between the collection and the submission of evidence. CaseChain is attempting to address issues with the conventional chain of custody, such as evidence loss, theft, tampering, and worse, evidence manipulation within the evidence management system.
